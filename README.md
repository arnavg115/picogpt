# picogpt
GPT2 in numpy. A worse version of the original [picogpt](https://github.com/jaymody/picoGPT) (didn't find it until after I finished the project). Based on [mingpt](https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT) by Andrej Karpathy and other sources (check notebook). Use cupy for gpu support rather than numpy for faster inference. Also loads a version of gpt 2 trained on the alpaca dataset for better results.
